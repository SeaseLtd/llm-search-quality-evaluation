# (Optional) Filter query to restrict the set of documents used to generate queries.
# If a field has more than one value, the documents retrieved have at least one of the values in the field (OR-
# -like). If there are more than one fields, the documents are filtered for both fields (AND-like)
# Default: all documents are considered and no filter is applied

#  - genre:
#      - "horror"

# List of fields from documents used to generate queries and relevance scoring
# These should match fields available in the search engine schema
# Must be at least one field
doc_fields:
  - "title"
  - "description"
  - "content"

# (Optional) File containing predefined queries to use instead of or alongside generated ones
# If available, must be in a txt format.
#queries: "templates/queries.txt"

# (Optional) Whether to generate queries from documents
# Default: true; set to false to disable query generation from documents

# Total number of queries to generate (includes predefined queries, if any)
num_queries_needed: 4

# Relevance scale used for scoring document relevance
# Accepted values:
#   - binary: 0 (not relevant), 1 (relevant)
#   - graded: 0 (not relevant), 1 (maybe ok), 2 (that’s my result)

# Path to the LLM configuration file (e.g., LangChain setup)

# (Optional) max number of query terms to be generated by the LLM
# max_query_terms: 5

# Output format for the generated dataset
# Accepted values: quepid, rre, mteb
output_format: "quepid"

# For rre output format, you need other fields, e.g.:

# Path where the output dataset will be saved
# For rre, output dataset will be saved into output_destination/"ratings.json"
# For quepid, output dataset will be saved into output_destination/"quepid.csv"
# For mteb, the following three files will be saved into: corpus.jsonl, queries.jsonl, and candidates.jsonl
# corpus.jsonl contains <id,title,text> corpus records extracted from search engine.
# queries.jsonl contains <id,text> query records LLM-generated and/or user-defined.
# candidates.jsonl contains <query_id,doc_id,rating> candidate records.

# (Optional) Whether to save LLM rating score explanation to file
# Default: false; set to true to save LLM rating explanation
#save_llm_explanation: true

# (Optional**) File path where it contains <query, doc_id, rating, explanation> records.
# (**) When save_llm_explanation is set to True, this param needs to be present

# (Optional) Periodically persist in-memory datastore every N successful updates
# Lower values persist more frequently (safer) but can be slower; higher values persist less often (faster)
